Having recently graduated from Wesleyan University completing a double major in Mathematics and Economics, I proactively began working towards a career in Basketball Operations. I engaged in grassroots basketball, worked as a video coordinator for various NCAA collegiate basketball programs and progressed in my mental game of basketball through watching film everyday. I am taking on the task of furthering my overall knowledge of the enterprise of the sport as well as the basketball side throughout this year in the hopes of finding opportunities in professional basketball as a scout. In doing so, I found myself looking to excell in statistical analysis and came to this platform to enrich the already existing knowledge of the field I achieved in my time at Wesleyan. Through learning data manipulation, I will be in a position where I can write and run my own algorithms in order to make a more well-rounded decision when it comes to basketball. That may be in running drills with my kids, or with making decisions for managing a roster. Having thesse tools at my disposal, I would be able to have another step over the rest trying to do the same that I am. I am pursuing data science with the goal of making myself an asset to whatever program I will be fortunate to be a part of in the future.
