Scatter plots are a visualization technique used throughout the majority of your time at school and for some, in their professional life too. I can still remember plotting data points on a two-dimensional plane while in the 6th grade and attempting, yet failing, to describe what my project had gotten me in the most elementary terminology. Of course, back then I only had a set of elementary descriptive features to use at my disposal.

These plots are used to describe the relationship between variables. Most of the time it is used on a 2D surface, but you may even see higher dimensional use with vectors flying about. Scatter plots give us a concise overlook of our data points: including direction of data (positive or negative), strength of relation of variables, prescence of outliers (data points far from the rest), form of data (linear, non-linear), etc.

A strength that comes to mind with scatter plots is its ability to show large quanitities of data and then efficiently allow the user to draw a general idea of the relationship and summary of the data. You may see if the data is categorical or continuous for instance, or you may be able to see the correlation between variables. However, with anything, there is almost always a negative. The biggest issue in my opinion with scatterplots is plotting the data as accurately as possible. With the discretization of data points, we can find issues of accuracy and thus have a swayed idea of what our data is showing us.

Considering the issue I brought up depends on the data itself, I would still recommend using a scatter plot at least once when working on a project as more good would be brought out of your work then tarnished.
